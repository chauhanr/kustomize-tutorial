# Basic Example 

The first example in along the lines of the 101 tutorial on the Stack Labs Site
[site](https://blog.stack-labs.com/code/kustomize-101/) 

The main purpose of the example is to see how we can run the base and overlays and introduce new
environment variables and secrets. The kustomize tool can help build the kubernetes configurations
very easily. 

It is easier to understand and change than helm repo and charts.
